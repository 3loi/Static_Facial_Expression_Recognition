# Static_Facial_Expression_Recognition

Contains API to use a VGG model trained on recognizing four primary emotional classes (happiness, sadness, anger, neutral).

The code was developed using Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV.
1. Tensorflow 1.14
2. Keras 
3. OpenCV
4. python 3.6

To use the model in python look at demo.py

To quickly run the model on a set of images, you can run via command line. Note that the inference results will be saved in results.txt in the same directory as program file (run_model.py)
